# Evaluating GraphQL for RepoScoop

This document analyzes the feasibility of adopting GraphQL instead of the current REST-based approach for RepoScoop. It explains what would need to change, outlines pros and cons, considers our Cloudflare deployment, and proposes an incremental migration plan.

Last updated: 2025-08-09

## Executive Summary

- RepoScoop fetches GitHub release data and renders a grouped view in SvelteKit (Svelte 5), deployed on Cloudflare.
- We can adopt GraphQL in two primary ways:
  1. Query GitHub’s GraphQL API v4 directly from the client or SvelteKit server endpoints.
  2. Introduce our own GraphQL gateway (BFF) that aggregates GitHub resources and exposes a tailored schema for RepoScoop.
- Recommendation (short-term): Use GitHub GraphQL v4 directly for read-only release data to reduce overfetching and HTTP round trips. Keep our REST fallback for parity during migration.
- Recommendation (long-term/optional): If we need multi-source aggregation, complex projection, or offline caching with stable contracts, consider adding a lightweight GraphQL gateway running on Cloudflare (e.g., Cloudflare Workers with Helix/GraphQL Yoga).

## Current State (REST)

- Data source: GitHub REST API (v3) to fetch releases, tags, and repository metadata.
- Likely flow: One or more REST calls per repository (and potentially per page) to retrieve releases, then client-side grouping into packages using heuristics.
- Drawbacks observed/expected:
  - Overfetching or underfetching across multiple endpoints.
  - Multiple round trips, especially for per-release extra details.
  - Tight coupling to REST response shapes; adding fields often requires additional requests.

## GraphQL Options

### Option A: Use GitHub GraphQL API v4 directly

- Pros:
  - Single query can fetch a repository, its releases (with pagination), and nested fields (e.g., author, assets) in one round trip.
  - Reduced overfetching by selecting only necessary fields, reducing payload size.
  - Strongly typed schema with introspection; easier evolvability.
- Cons:
  - Requires learning GitHub’s GraphQL schema, connection/edges pagination, and rate-limit patterns.
  - Some data might still be easier via REST if certain endpoints aren’t covered or if limits differ.
  - Client-side auth and rate-limits may require proxying via server if tokens should be kept secret.

### Option B: Introduce a RepoScoop GraphQL Gateway (BFF)

- Pros:
  - Tailored schema matching RepoScoop UI needs (e.g., ReleaseGroup, PackageRelease).
  - Ability to combine multiple upstreams (GitHub REST/GraphQL, npm, custom metadata) behind one contract.
  - Centralized caching, auth, and rate-limit protection; use persisted queries.
- Cons:
  - Additional operational complexity (new service) and maintenance burden.
  - Potential cold starts and latency if not carefully cached on Cloudflare.
  - Requires CI/CD changes and observability for a new layer.

## Changes Needed

### 1) Data Fetching Layer

- Replace or augment REST requests with GraphQL queries.
- Implement pagination using GraphQL connections (cursors), not page/offset.
- Add a minimal GraphQL client:
  - For client-side: urql or Apollo Client (urql is lightweight).
  - For server-side (SvelteKit load functions/actions): a simple fetch-based helper or graphql-request.

### 2) Authentication & Secrets

- If querying GitHub GraphQL from the client:
  - Public unauthenticated reads are very limited. Better to avoid sending tokens to the client.
- Recommended: Query from the server side (SvelteKit + Cloudflare adapter) with a GitHub token stored in Cloudflare environment variables (bindings). Expose only the data needed to the client.

### 3) Schema & Query Design

- Identify fields needed by the UI for each repo page:
  - Repo metadata (name, description, default branch)
  - Releases: tagName, publishedAt, body, author, assets, associated commits/PRs if needed
  - Pagination strategy for large repos
- Draft queries that fetch exactly the required fields. Consider fragments to share selections.

### 4) Caching Strategy

- At the edge (Cloudflare):
  - Cache successful GraphQL responses keyed by repo + query + variables + auth context.
  - Use Cache-Control headers where appropriate; consider time-based revalidation (e.g., 1–5 minutes) and conditional revalidation.
- Client caching (if using urql/apollo): normalized cache to avoid refetches when navigating.

### 5) Error Handling & Limits

- Map GraphQL errors (partial data + errors array) into our UI-friendly error states.
- Handle GitHub’s GraphQL rate limits and abuse detection.
- Implement retries/backoff and graceful degradation to REST where necessary during migration.

### 6) Tooling & DX

- Add GraphQL code generation (optional but recommended):
  - graphql-code-generator to produce TypeScript types and typed query hooks.
  - Store documents in src/lib/graphql/.
- Linting/checks: ensure generated types are part of the type-check pipeline.

### 7) Testing

- Unit tests for query builders/mappers.
- Component tests with mocked GraphQL responses (MSW GraphQL or urql test utilities).
- E2E: test common repos to ensure data parity with REST.

### 8) Deployment/Infra (Cloudflare)

- Using SvelteKit’s Cloudflare adapter:
  - Server-side GraphQL calls from load functions/actions will run in Cloudflare Workers runtime.
  - Store GitHub token in Cloudflare environment variables (Pages/Workers bindings/secrets).
- If adding a GraphQL gateway:
  - Deploy gateway as a Worker; configure routes and bindings.
  - Add observability (logs, metrics) and cache layer (KV, R2, cache API) as needed.

## Pros & Cons Summary

### Pros

- Fewer network round trips via single tailored queries.
- Precise field selection reduces payloads and speeds up rendering.
- Strong typing and introspection improve maintainability.
- Better fit for complex UIs and potential future aggregations.

### Cons

- Learning curve for GraphQL and GitHub’s schema, plus pagination model.
- Extra tooling (client, codegen, mocks) introduces complexity.
- Potentially higher perceived complexity for simple use cases.
- Rate-limit management and error handling differ from REST.

## Security Considerations

- Do not expose long-lived GitHub tokens to the browser.
- Prefer server-side GraphQL requests using secure env vars.
- Consider short TTL caches and revalidation to limit token usage.
- Validate and sanitize any user-provided parameters used in GraphQL variables.

## Performance Considerations

- Use query-level minimization (only fields needed).
- Implement connection pagination (fetch in batches) and UI-level virtualized rendering for long lists.
- Cache at the edge whenever possible; avoid head-of-line blocking during cold starts.
- For gateway approach, consider persisted queries to improve cache hit rates.

## Migration Plan (Incremental)

1. Discovery & Parity

- Inventory current REST endpoints and fields used in UI.
- Draft GraphQL queries to match feature parity for the repository releases page.

2. Introduce Server-side GraphQL Calls

- Replace server-side REST calls in the releases route with GraphQL (behind a feature flag).
- Keep REST code path as a fallback until confidence is high.

3. Add Tooling

- Introduce graphql-request or urql on the server; optionally add code generation.
- Add MSW GraphQL mocks for unit/component tests.

4. Caching & Limits

- Add Cloudflare cache for GraphQL responses; implement revalidation strategy.
- Monitor rate limits; adjust TTLs and batch sizes.

5. Expand Coverage

- Gradually migrate other REST calls (repo metadata, tags) to GraphQL.
- If multi-source data is needed, evaluate a small Worker-based GraphQL gateway.

6. Cleanup

- Remove REST paths once parity, performance, and reliability are proven.

## Decision Points & Checklist

- Can the required data be fetched from GitHub GraphQL v4 with acceptable rate limits?
- Is server-side fetching acceptable for our UX and security posture?
- Do we benefit meaningfully from reduced overfetching and round trips?
- Do we foresee aggregating multiple sources soon (justifying a gateway)?
- Can we support the added tooling (codegen, mocks) within our DX constraints?

## Alternatives Considered

- Continue with REST only: simplest operationally, but more round trips; may be fine if performance is acceptable and scope remains limited.
- Hybrid: Use REST for endpoints not supported or simpler to consume; use GraphQL for complex nested queries. Likely the pragmatic path.

## Rough Effort Estimate

- Direct GitHub GraphQL (no gateway): 1–3 days for initial parity on releases page (including queries, pagination, caching, tests, and docs) depending on familiarity with GraphQL.
- Gateway approach: 1–2 weeks for MVP (schema design, Worker setup, caching, CI/CD, observability), plus ongoing maintenance.

If we proceed, start with Option A (direct GitHub GraphQL from SvelteKit server), guarded by a feature flag, with edge caching and thorough tests. This achieves benefits quickly with minimal operational overhead.
