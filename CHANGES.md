# Changes Implemented

This document summarizes the changes made to address the requirements:

1. Use bun instead of npm
2. Fix the issue of the app running forever when started by Junie

## 1. Switch from npm to bun

### Package.json Updates

- Updated the test script to use bun instead of npm:
  ```
  "test": "bun run test:unit"
  ```

### Documentation Updates

The following documentation files were updated to use bun as the recommended package manager:

#### README.md

- Updated Prerequisites section to list bun as the recommended package manager
- Updated Installation section to show bun install first
- Updated Playwright installation to use bunx
- Updated all development, testing, and build commands to use bun

#### CONTRIBUTING.md

- Updated Setting Up the Development Environment section to use bun install
- Updated Playwright installation to use bunx
- Updated all testing commands to use bun

#### .junie/guidelines.md

- Updated Dependencies Installation section to list bun as the recommended package manager
- Updated Playwright installation to use bunx
- Updated all development, testing, build, and code quality commands to use bun

## 2. Fix the Issue of the App Running Forever

### Problem Analysis

The issue occurs because the development server started by `bun run dev` is designed to run continuously until manually terminated. This is normal behavior for development servers, but it creates a problem in environments where a long-running process blocks further execution (such as when Junie runs commands).

### Solutions Implemented

Added new scripts to package.json that provide alternatives to the standard development server:

1. **Time-Limited Development Server**

   ```
   "dev:timed": "sh -c 'bun run dev & PID=$!; sleep 30; kill $PID 2>/dev/null || true; echo \"Dev server stopped after timeout\"'"
   ```

   This script runs the development server for 30 seconds and then automatically terminates it.

2. **Background Development Server**

   ```
   "dev:background": "bun run dev &"
   ```

   This script runs the development server in the background, immediately returning control to the terminal.

3. **Time-Limited Production Preview**
   ```
   "preview:timed": "sh -c 'bun run preview & PID=$!; sleep 30; kill $PID 2>/dev/null || true; echo \"Preview server stopped after timeout\"'"
   ```
   Similar to the timed development server, but for previewing the production build.

### New Documentation

Created a new DEVELOPMENT.md file that provides comprehensive guidance on:

- Running the development server in different modes
- Using the time-limited and background options
- Managing background processes
- Testing, code quality, and package management
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Recommendations for Junie

When running the app, Junie should use one of these approaches:

1. **Preferred: Use the time-limited script**

   ```bash
   bun run dev:timed
   ```

   This will run the server for 30 seconds and then automatically stop it, allowing Junie to continue with other tasks.

2. **Alternative: Use the background script**
   ```bash
   bun run dev:background
   ```
   This will start the server in the background, immediately returning control to Junie. However, the server will continue running until manually terminated.

These solutions ensure that Junie can run the app without getting stuck in a long-running process that requires manual termination.
