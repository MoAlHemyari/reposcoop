# RepoScoop Project Overview

## Project Description

RepoScoop is a web application designed to solve the problem of navigating releases in large GitHub repositories, particularly monorepos with multiple packages. When a GitHub repository contains multiple packages that are published individually, the releases page displays them in chronological order, which creates several challenges:

1. Users cannot easily identify which packages are published in the repository
2. Finding releases for a specific package may require scrolling through multiple pages
3. The search functionality often returns inaccurate results as it searches the entire release body, not just the title

RepoScoop addresses these issues by providing a clean, organized interface that:
- Lists all releases in a repository
- Groups them by package name
- Displays them in a clear, collapsible format for easy navigation

The application follows a "single-input workflow" philosophy, allowing users to simply paste a GitHub repository URL and instantly get an organized view of all releases, grouped by package.

## Problem Domain

### Current GitHub Limitations

GitHub's release page has several limitations when dealing with monorepos:

- **Chronological ordering only**: Releases are displayed in order of release date, with no option to filter by package
- **Limited filtering capabilities**: No built-in way to view releases for only a specific package
- **Search limitations**: Search includes the entire release body, making it difficult to find specific package releases
- **Navigation challenges**: Users may need to scroll through multiple pages to find what they're looking for

### RepoScoop Solution

RepoScoop transforms this experience by:

- **Smart package detection**: Automatically identifying and grouping releases by package name
- **Hierarchical organization**: Displaying packages as collapsible sections with their respective releases
- **Efficient navigation**: Allowing users to quickly find and focus on the packages they care about
- **Clean, accessible UI**: Providing a modern interface built with shadcn-svelte for optimal user experience

## Initial Architecture Plan

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Routing Structure**
   - `/` - Home page with repository input form
   - `/r/:owner/:repo` - Repository view page showing grouped releases
   - `/about` - Information about the project

2. **Component Hierarchy**
   - `Layout` - Main application layout
   - `RepoInput` - Repository URL input component
   - `ReleasesList` - Container for grouped releases
   - `PackageGroup` - Collapsible section for a package's releases
   - `ReleaseItem` - Individual release with version and notes

3. **State Management**
   - Use Svelte stores for application state
   - Store repository data and grouped releases
   - Implement caching for previously viewed repositories

4. **Data Fetching**
   - Client-side fetching from GitHub API
   - Implement pagination for repositories with many releases
   - Handle rate limiting and error states

### Backend Considerations (Future)

While the initial implementation will be client-side only, the architecture will be designed to accommodate future server-side features:

- Server-side rendering for improved performance
- Caching of GitHub API responses
- Authentication for accessing private repositories
- Analytics for tracking popular repositories

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: SvelteKit with Svelte 5
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with @tailwindcss/forms and @tailwindcss/typography
- **UI Components**: shadcn-svelte for accessible, consistent UI
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages via @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests

   - Implement client-side fetching from GitHub API (see example responses in `examples/clerk/javascript/`)
   - Handle pagination for repositories with many releases (as demonstrated in the example files)
   - Implement error handling and loading states
   - Use example data for development and testing without hitting API rate limits

4. **Release Grouping Logic**
   - Develop algorithm to detect package names from release titles
   - Group releases by package name
   - Sort packages and releases appropriately

5. **Basic UI Implementation**
   - Create collapsible package groups
   - Implement release item display
   - Add basic styling and responsiveness

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience

1. **Advanced UI Features**
   - Implement collapsible release notes
   - Add syntax highlighting for code blocks in release notes
   - Create filtering and search functionality

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement client-side caching
   - Optimize rendering for repositories with many releases
   - Add lazy loading for release content

3. **User Preferences**
   - Add dark/light mode toggle
   - Implement user preferences storage
   - Add customization options for display

4. **Sharing and Integration**
   - Implement URL sharing functionality
   - Add copy-to-clipboard features
   - Create embeddable views

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

1. **Server-Side Rendering**
   - Implement SSR for improved performance
   - Add server-side caching of GitHub API responses
   - Optimize for SEO

2. **Authentication**
   - Add GitHub authentication
   - Implement access to private repositories
   - Add user-specific features

3. **Analytics and Insights**
   - Add repository statistics
   - Implement release trend visualization
   - Create package comparison features

4. **Community Features**
   - Add commenting or annotation capabilities
   - Implement user collections of repositories
   - Create sharing and collaboration features

## Development Resources

### Example Data

The project includes example GitHub API responses in the `examples/clerk/javascript` directory:

- **page1.jsonc**, **page2.jsonc**, **page3.jsonc**: Real-world API responses from the clerk/javascript repository
- Retrieved from `https://api.github.com/repos/clerk/javascript/releases?page=N&per_page=100`
- Demonstrates pagination with the `page` parameter (100 releases per page)
- Contains a variety of packages within a single monorepo:
  - @clerk/chrome-extension
  - @clerk/backend
  - @clerk/astro
  - @clerk/react-router
  - @clerk/nuxt
  - @clerk/nextjs
  - And many more

These examples showcase the exact structure of GitHub API responses that RepoScoop will process:

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/clerk/javascript/releases/228021514",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/clerk/javascript/releases/tag/%40clerk/chrome-extension%402.5.1",
  "tag_name": "@clerk/chrome-extension@2.5.1",
  "name": "@clerk/chrome-extension@2.5.1",
  "published_at": "2025-06-26T13:45:37Z",
  "body": "### Patch Changes\n\n- Updated dependencies..."
}
```

The examples illustrate key challenges that RepoScoop addresses:
1. Multiple packages mixed chronologically across pages
2. Package names embedded in `tag_name` and `name` fields
3. Release notes in Markdown format within the `body` field

Developers can use these examples for testing the application's parsing, grouping, and display functionality without hitting GitHub API rate limits during development.

## Technical Considerations

### API Limitations

- GitHub API has rate limits that need to be handled (60 requests/hour for unauthenticated requests)
- Large repositories may have hundreds of releases requiring pagination (as shown in the example files)
- API responses need to be cached to minimize requests

### Performance Considerations

- Client-side grouping and filtering must be efficient
- Rendering large numbers of releases needs optimization
- Markdown rendering in release notes may be resource-intensive

### Accessibility

- All components must be keyboard navigable
- Color contrast must meet WCAG standards
- Screen reader compatibility is essential

### Browser Compatibility

- Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Conclusion

RepoScoop aims to significantly improve the experience of navigating releases in GitHub repositories, particularly for monorepos with multiple packages. By providing a clean, organized interface with smart grouping and filtering capabilities, it addresses the limitations of GitHub's native release page and offers a more efficient way to find and explore package releases.

The phased implementation approach allows for incremental development and testing, with a focus on delivering core functionality first before adding more advanced features. The architecture is designed to be scalable and maintainable, with consideration for future enhancements such as server-side rendering and authentication for private repositories.
