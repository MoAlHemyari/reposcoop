    "body": "### Minor Changes\n\n-   ## Optimize handshake payload delivery with nonce-based fetching ([#5905](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/5905)) by [@jacekradko](https://github.com/jacekradko)\n\n    This change introduces a significant optimization to the handshake flow by replacing direct payload delivery with a nonce-based approach to overcome browser cookie size limitations.\n\n    ## Problem Solved\n\n    Previously, the handshake payload (an encoded JWT containing set-cookie headers) was sent directly in a cookie. Since browsers limit cookies to ~4KB, this severely restricted the practical size of session tokens, which are also JWTs stored in cookies but embedded within the handshake payload.\n\n    ## Solution\n\n    We now use a conditional approach based on payload size:\n\n    -   **Small payloads (≤2KB)**: Continue using the direct approach for optimal performance\n    -   **Large payloads (>2KB)**: Use nonce-based fetching to avoid cookie size limits\n\n    For large payloads, we:\n\n    1.  Generate a short nonce (ID) for each handshake instance\n    2.  Send only the nonce in the `__clerk_handshake_nonce` cookie\n    3.  Use the nonce to fetch the actual handshake payload via a dedicated BAPI endpoint\n\n    ## New Handshake Flow (for payloads >2KB)\n\n    1.  User visits `example.com`\n    2.  Client app middleware triggers handshake → `307 FAPI/v1/client/handshake`\n    3.  FAPI handshake resolves → `307 example.com` with `__clerk_handshake_nonce` cookie containing the nonce\n    4.  Client app middleware makes `GET BAPI/v1/clients/handshake_payload?nonce=<nonce_value>` request (BAPI)\n    5.  BAPI returns array of set-cookie header values\n    6.  Client app middleware applies headers to the response\n\n    ## Traditional Flow (for payloads ≤2KB)\n\n    No changes. Continues to work as before with direct payload delivery in cookies for optimal performance.\n\n    ## Trade-offs\n\n    -   **Added**: One additional BAPI call per handshake (only for payloads >2KB)\n    -   **Removed**: Cookie size restrictions that previously limited session token size\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n-   Ensure `__clerk_synced` is removed from cross-origin return-back urls ([#6196](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/6196)) by [@tmilewski](https://github.com/tmilewski)\n\n-   Updated dependencies \\[[`f1be1fe`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/f1be1fe3d575c11acd04fc7aadcdec8f89829894), [`bffb42a`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/bffb42aaf266a188b9ae7d16ace3024d468a3bd4)]:\n    -   @clerk/types@4.62.0\n    -   @clerk/shared@3.10.0\n"

For backwards compatibility, `session_token` remains the default when no token type is specified. This enables machine-to-machine authentication and use cases such as API keys and OAuth integrations. Existing applications continue to work without modification. ([#6067](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/6067)) by [@wobsoriano](https://github.com/wobsoriano)\n\n    You can specify which token types are allowed by using the `acceptsToken` option in the `getAuth()` function. This option can be set to a specific type, an array of types, or `'any'` to accept all supported tokens.\n\n    Example usage:\n\n    ```ts\n    import Fastify from 'fastify';\n    import { getAuth } from '@clerk/fastify';\n\n    const fastify = Fastify();\n\n    fastify.get('/path', (request, reply) => {\n      const authObject = getAuth(req, { acceptsToken: 'any' });\n\n      if (authObject.tokenType === 'session_token') {\n        console.log('this is session token from a user');\n      } else {\n        console.log('this is some other type of machine token');\n        console.log('more specifically, a ' + authObject.tokenType);\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n-   Updated dependencies \\[[`19e9e11`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/19e9e11af04f13fd12975fbf7016fe0583202056), [`18bcb64`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/18bcb64a3e8b6d352d7933ed094d68214e6e80fb), [`2148166`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/214816654850272297056eebad3d846b7f8125c9), [`4319257`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/4319257dc424f121231a26bef2068cef1e78afd4), [`607d333`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/607d3331f893bc98d1a8894f57b1cb9021e71b86), [`138f733`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/138f733f13121487268a4f96e6eb2cffedc6e238), [`4118ed7`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/4118ed7c8fb13ca602401f8d663e7bcd6f6abee4), [`d832d91`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/d832d9179ff615f2799c832ec5fd9f3d79c6a940), [`6842ff1`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/6842ff1c903eaa0db161f533365a2e680995ce83), [`48be55b`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/48be55b61a86e014dd407414764d24bb43fd26f3), [`183e382`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/183e3823e4ff70e856b00a347369c38a4264105a), [`2c6f805`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/2c6f805a9e6e4685990f9a8abc740b2d0859a453), [`97749d5`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/97749d570bc687c7e05cd800a50e0ae4180a371d)]:\n    -   @clerk/types@4.60.1\n    -   @clerk/backend@2.1.0\n    -   @clerk/shared@3.9.7\n"

For backwards compatibility, `session_token` remains the default when no token type is specified. This enables machine-to-machine authentication and use cases such as API keys and OAuth integrations. Existing applications continue to work without modification. ([#6067](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/6067)) by [@wobsoriano](https://github.com/wobsoriano)\n\n    You can specify which token types are allowed by using the `acceptsToken` option in the `getAuth()` function. This option can be set to a specific type, an array of types, or `'any'` to accept all supported tokens.\n\n    Example usage:\n\n    ```ts\n    import express from 'express';\n    import { getAuth } from '@clerk/express';\n\n    const app = express();\n\n    app.get('/path', (req, res) => {\n      const authObject = getAuth(req, { acceptsToken: 'any' });\n\n      if (authObject.tokenType === 'session_token') {\n        console.log('this is session token from a user');\n      } else {\n        console.log('this is some other type of machine token');\n        console.log('more specifically, a ' + authObject.tokenType);\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n-   Updated dependencies \\[[`19e9e11`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/19e9e11af04f13fd12975fbf7016fe0583202056), [`18bcb64`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/18bcb64a3e8b6d352d7933ed094d68214e6e80fb), [`2148166`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/214816654850272297056eebad3d846b7f8125c9), [`4319257`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/4319257dc424f121231a26bef2068cef1e78afd4), [`607d333`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/607d3331f893bc98d1a8894f57b1cb9021e71b86), [`138f733`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/138f733f13121487268a4f96e6eb2cffedc6e238), [`4118ed7`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/4118ed7c8fb13ca602401f8d663e7bcd6f6abee4), [`d832d91`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/d832d9179ff615f2799c832ec5fd9f3d79c6a940), [`6842ff1`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/6842ff1c903eaa0db161f533365a2e680995ce83), [`48be55b`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/48be55b61a86e014dd407414764d24bb43fd26f3), [`183e382`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/183e3823e4ff70e856b00a347369c38a4264105a), [`2c6f805`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/2c6f805a9e6e4685990f9a8abc740b2d0859a453), [`97749d5`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/97749d570bc687c7e05cd800a50e0ae4180a371d)]:\n    -   @clerk/types@4.60.1\n    -   @clerk/backend@2.1.0\n    -   @clerk/shared@3.9.7\n"

    "body": "### Minor Changes\n\n-   Machine authentication is now supported for advanced use cases via the backend SDK.

    "body": "### Minor Changes\n\n-   Introduces machine authentication, supporting four token types: `api_key`, `oauth_token`, `machine_token`, and `session_token`. For backwards compatibility, `session_token` remains the default when no token type is specified. This enables machine-to-machine authentication and use cases such as API keys and OAuth integrations. Existing applications continue to work without modification. ([#5689](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/5689)) by [@wobsoriano](https://github.com/wobsoriano)\n\n    You can specify which token types are allowed for a given route or handler using the `acceptsToken` property in the `auth()` helper, or the `token` property in the `auth.protect()` helper. Each can be set to a specific type, an array of types, or `'any'` to accept all supported tokens.\n\n    Example usage in Nextjs middleware:\n\n    ```ts\n    import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';\n\n    const isOAuthAccessible = createRouteMatcher(['/oauth(.*)']);\n    const isApiKeyAccessible = createRouteMatcher(['/api(.*)']);\n    const isMachineTokenAccessible = createRouteMatcher(['/m2m(.*)']);\n    const isUserAccessible = createRouteMatcher(['/user(.*)']);\n    const isAccessibleToAnyValidToken = createRouteMatcher(['/any(.*)']);\n\n    export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {\n      if (isOAuthAccessible(req)) await auth.protect({ token: 'oauth_token' });\n      if (isApiKeyAccessible(req)) await auth.protect({ token: 'api_key' });\n      if (isMachineTokenAccessible(req)) await auth.protect({ token: 'machine_token' });\n      if (isUserAccessible(req)) await auth.protect({ token: 'session_token' });\n\n      if (isAccessibleToAnyValidToken(req)) await auth.protect({ token: 'any' });\n    });\n\n    export const config = {\n      matcher: [\n        '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',\n        '/(api|trpc)(.*)',\n      ],\n    };\n    ```\n\n    Leaf node route protection:\n\n    ```ts\n    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';\n\n    // In this example, we allow users and oauth tokens with the \"profile\" scope\n    // to access the data. Other types of tokens are rejected.\n    function POST(req, res) {\n      const authObject = await auth({ acceptsToken: ['session_token', 'oauth_token'] });\n\n      if (authObject.tokenType === 'oauth_token' && !authObject.scopes?.includes('profile')) {\n        throw new Error('Unauthorized: OAuth token missing the \"profile\" scope');\n      }\n\n      // get data from db using userId\n      const data = db.select().from(user).where(eq(user.id, authObject.userId));\n\n      return { data };\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   The `svix` dependency is no longer needed when using the `verifyWebhook()` function. `verifyWebhook()` was refactored to not rely on `svix` anymore while keeping the same functionality and behavior.

    "body": "### Minor Changes\n\n-   Machine authentication is now supported for advanced use cases via the backend SDK. You can use `clerkClient.authenticateRequest` to validate machine tokens (such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and machine-to-machine tokens). No new helpers are included in these packages yet. ([#5689](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/5689)) by [@wobsoriano](https://github.com/wobsoriano)\n\n    Example (Astro):\n\n    ```ts\n    import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/astro/server';\n\n    export const GET: APIRoute = ({ request }) => {\n      const requestState = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(request, {\n        acceptsToken: 'api_key',\n      });\n\n      if (!requestState.isAuthenticated) {\n        return new Response(401, { message: 'Unauthorized' });\n      }\n\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify(requestState.toAuth()));\n    };\n    ```\n\n-   The `svix` dependency is no longer needed when using the `verifyWebhook()` function. `verifyWebhook()` was refactored to not rely on `svix` anymore while keeping the same functionality and behavior. ([#6059](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/6059)) by [@royanger](https://github.com/royanger)\n\n    If you previously installed `svix` to use `verifyWebhook()` you can uninstall it now:\n\n    ```shell\n    npm uninstall svix\n    ```\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n-   Updated dependencies \\[[`ea622ba`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/ea622bae90e18ae2ea8dbc6c94cad857557539c9), [`d8fa5d9`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/d8fa5d9d3d8dc575260d8d2b7c7eeeb0052d0b0d), [`be2e89c`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/be2e89ca11aa43d48f74c57a5a34e20d85b4003c), [`c656270`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/c656270f9e05fd1f44fc4c81851be0b1111cb933), [`5644d94`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/5644d94f711a0733e4970c3f15c24d56cafc8743), [`b578225`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/b5782258242474c9b0987a3f8349836cd763f24b), [`918e2e0`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/918e2e085bf88c3cfaa5fcb0f1ae8c31b3f7053e), [`795d09a`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/795d09a652f791e1e409406e335e0860aceda110), [`4f93634`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/4f93634ed6bcd45f21bddcb39a33434b1cb560fe), [`8838120`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/8838120596830b88fec1c6c853371dabfec74a0d)]:\n    -   @clerk/backend@2.0.0\n    -   @clerk/types@4.60.0\n    -   @clerk/shared@3.9.6\n"

For backwards compatibility, `session_token` remains the default when no token type is specified. This enables machine-to-machine authentication and use cases such as API keys and OAuth integrations. Existing applications continue to work without modification. ([#5689](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/5689)) by [@wobsoriano](https://github.com/wobsoriano)\r\n\r\n    You can specify which token types are allowed by using the `acceptsToken` option in the `authenticateRequest()` function. This option can be set to a specific type, an array of types, or `'any'` to accept all supported tokens.\r\n\r\n    Example usage:\r\n\r\n    ```ts\r\n    import express from 'express';\r\n    import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend';\r\n\r\n    const app = express();\r\n    const clerkClient = createClerkClient({ secretKey: 'sk_xxx', publishableKey: 'pk_xxx' });\r\n\r\n    app.use(async (req, res, next) => {\r\n      const requestState = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req, {\r\n        acceptsToken: 'any',\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      if (!requestState.isAuthenticated) {\r\n        // do something for unauthenticated requests\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      const authObject = requestState.toAuth();\r\n\r\n      if (authObject.tokenType === 'session_token') {\r\n        console.log('this is session token from a user');\r\n      } else {\r\n        console.log('this is some other type of machine token');\r\n        console.log('more specifically, a ' + authObject.tokenType);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      // Attach the auth object to locals so downstream handlers\r\n      // and middleware can access it\r\n      res.locals.auth = authObject;\r\n      next();\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Minor Changes\r\n\r\n-   The `svix` dependency is no longer needed when using the `verifyWebhook()` function. `verifyWebhook()` was refactored to not rely on `svix` anymore while keeping the same functionality and behavior.

You can use `clerkClient.authenticateRequest` to validate machine tokens (such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and machine-to-machine tokens). No new helpers are included in these packages yet. ([#5689](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/5689)) by [@wobsoriano](https://github.com/wobsoriano)\n\n    Example (Astro):\n\n    ```ts\n    import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/astro/server';\n\n    export const GET: APIRoute = ({ request }) => {\n      const requestState = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(request, {\n        acceptsToken: 'api_key',\n      });\n\n      if (!requestState.isAuthenticated) {\n        return new Response(401, { message: 'Unauthorized' });\n      }\n\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify(requestState.toAuth()));\n    };\n    ```\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n-   Updated dependencies \\[[`ea622ba`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/ea622bae90e18ae2ea8dbc6c94cad857557539c9), [`d8fa5d9`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/d8fa5d9d3d8dc575260d8d2b7c7eeeb0052d0b0d), [`be2e89c`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/be2e89ca11aa43d48f74c57a5a34e20d85b4003c), [`c656270`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/c656270f9e05fd1f44fc4c81851be0b1111cb933), [`5644d94`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/5644d94f711a0733e4970c3f15c24d56cafc8743), [`b578225`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/b5782258242474c9b0987a3f8349836cd763f24b), [`918e2e0`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/918e2e085bf88c3cfaa5fcb0f1ae8c31b3f7053e), [`795d09a`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/795d09a652f791e1e409406e335e0860aceda110), [`4f93634`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/4f93634ed6bcd45f21bddcb39a33434b1cb560fe), [`8838120`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/commit/8838120596830b88fec1c6c853371dabfec74a0d)]:\n    -   @clerk/backend@2.0.0\n    -   @clerk/types@4.60.0\n    -   @clerk/shared@3.9.6\n"
